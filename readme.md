# IIE: Intra-sample and Intra-modal Enhancement for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Missing Modalities
The code for Intra-sample and Intra-modal Enhancement for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Missing Modalities, which is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia ([TMM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11303977)). The code is being organized and will be released.

### Prerequisites:
```
* Python 3.8.10
* CUDA 11.5
* pytorch 1.12.1+cu113
* sentence-transformers 3.1.1
* transformers 4.30.2
```
**Note that the torch version can be changed to your cuda version, but please keep the transformers==4.30.2 as some functions will change in later versions**

### Pretrained model:
Downlaod the [BERT-base](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased/tree/main) , and put into directory ./BERT-EN/.

### Datasets:
**Please move the following datasets into directory ```./datasets/```**

The aligned CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets can be downloaded from [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1FW7A-gfbzomKjj_-7ZR8Og?pwd=8xii) with extraction code 8xii, rename the pkl as ```aligned_{dataset}.pkl```. 

### Run IIE
For fixed missing scenarios on MOSI and MOSEI datasets, please run the following code by changing ```--dataset``` in ```run.sh```:
```
bash run.sh
```
